### TOOLS USED
- Microsoft Excel: Used for data cleaning and visualization.

- SQL: Applied for data cleaning using queries.

- Power BI: Employed for both data cleaning and visualization.

### DATA CLEANING
This is the first stage for any data analysis project which includes 

* Uploading the data

* Checking for null variables and missing data
  
* Data cleaning which includes removing duplicates


### STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ON THE CUSTOMER DATA
