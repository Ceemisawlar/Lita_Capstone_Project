### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel for data cleaning,Analysis and Visualisation 
- SQL - Structured query Language for querying data for building of Portfolio in Github
- Power Bi - For Data cleaning and Visualization

### Data Cleaning
This is the first stage for any data analysis project which includes 

* Uploading the data

* Checking for null variables and missing data
  
* Data cleaning which includes removing duplicates


### STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ON THE CUSTOMER DATA
- Total sales for each prroduct category
- Number of sales category in each region
  
  select region, count(orderid) as Num_sales_transaction
from LITAcustomers group by region order by
Num_sales_transaction desc

  SELECT top 1 product,
SUM(cast(quantity as int) * cast(unitprice as decimal)) AS total_sales
FROM 
LITAcustomers
GROUP BY

WHERE 
YEAR(orderdate) = YEAR(GETDATE())
GROUP BY 
DATENAME(month, orderdate)

### STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ON SALES DATA



### Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) examines and visualizes data to understand its main characteristics and answer meaniful questions

### For sales Data using Excel the following insights where gotten

1)Average sales was retrieved using the in built formula in excel 

2)Total sales

3)Sum of quantity of product

4)Month by sum of sales

5)Total sales by region

6)Sum of sales by each quarter

### Customer Data

* Retrieve the total number of customers from each region.
  
* Find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers.

* Find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months.

* Calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.

* Find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
